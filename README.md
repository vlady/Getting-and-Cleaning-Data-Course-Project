# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project README
There is a single file "run_analysis.R" that does the analysis required for the course project, including downloading the datasets needed. The file is well documented to explain all the steps.

There is a Cookbook.MD that describes the variables, transformations, and etc.

vdDataSet.txt is an example of an analysis run (what you would get if you ran the analysis script).
